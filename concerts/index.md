Our next official concert will be on Monday, May 22nd (Harvey Milk's birthday!)

The concert will feature a varied program of music on the themes of mother, home and country.

Details of time and place will be announced later as they become available.

Tentatively, there may also be a second concert on Monday, June 26 to close the season.   Stay tuned.
